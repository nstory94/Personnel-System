# Personnel-System
Created by Nicholas Story

This is a simple application used to demonstrate MVC-style architecture along with database integration. The application was coded in Java and the GUI was created with JavaFX. 
The application allows the user to select a manager from a dropdown list, and the employee table then populates all employees that are assigned to that manager. It also allows the user to add a new employee. All employees (including managers) are stored in a database which is accessed using queries each time employee information is required to be updated (in the event of adding a new employee) or retrieved (in the event of populating a table and/or list).
